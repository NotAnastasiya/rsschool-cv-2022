## SUMMARY
### Each new experience is a great opportunity to learn new skills or improve existing ones. Technical education gave me a wide range of new knowledge in various fields, taught me to approach the solution of a problem step by step, analyzing it and compiling a solution algorithm. My current experience as a sales manager has helped me develop skills such as multitasking and communication skills that will help me in my new profession.
